  "description": "Behavior3+ Editor is an open source visual tool to create and design Behavior Trees. It provides a general solution to model agents for games and other applications, such as simulations and robotics. Behavior3 Editor uses an open - and simple - format to describe the behavior trees, thus you can adapt easily to your own library, tool or framework. This is a special version of the editor adjusted to support all of the Luabehaviourtrees 2e nodes.",
